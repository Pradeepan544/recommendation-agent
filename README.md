# AI-Powered Recommendation Agent

## üìå Overview
This project is an AI-powered recommendation agent that provides personalized recommendations based on user profiles and external news sources. Users can submit their profiles, fetch news data from an external API, and receive recommendations tailored to their interests.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/news-recommendation.git
cd news-recommendation
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies
Ensure you have Python installed (Python 3.8 or later recommended). Then, install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up MongoDB
Ensure MongoDB is installed and running locally:
```bash
mongod --dbpath /path/to/your/db
```
Or use a cloud-based MongoDB service like [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database).

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up API Keys
Create a `.env` file and add the following API keys:
```env
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key
NEWS_API_KEY=your-newsapi-key
```
Replace `your-gemini-api-key` and `your-newsapi-key` with your actual API keys.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Application
Start the FastAPI server:
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

## üöÄ Usage Instructions

### ‚û°Ô∏è Add a User Profile
```bash
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/add_user" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
    "user_id": "123",
    "name": "John Doe",
    "interests": ["Technology", "AI"],
    "metadata": {"category": "Tech", "relevance_score": 0.9}
}'
```

### ‚û°Ô∏è Fetch & Store News for a User
```bash
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/add_news/123?category=technology"
```

### ‚û°Ô∏è Get AI-Generated News Recommendations
```bash
curl -X GET "http://127.0.0.1:8000/recommend/123"
```

## üìå Design Choices & Optimizations

1. **FastAPI for Scalability**: FastAPI was chosen for its speed, automatic validation, and async capabilities.
2. **MongoDB for Storage**: A NoSQL database was used to handle flexible user profiles and news data efficiently.
3. **Gemini AI Model**: Used Google Gemini to generate intelligent recommendations based on user interests and fetched news data.
4. **LangGraph for AI Workflow**: Ensured a structured AI pipeline for processing and generating recommendations.
5. **Efficient Querying**: Indexed MongoDB queries for faster retrieval of relevant user and news data.

## üîó API Endpoints
| Method | Endpoint | Description |
